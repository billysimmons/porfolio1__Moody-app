# Moody Application
OVERVIEW:  
React Application "Moody", that recommends music based on users mood and Spotify data. 

DESCRIPTION:  
Uses fetch requests to Spotify's API to acess a user's playlist data. Which is then sorted into mood using song data, such as song valence, energy, and danceability. Done using the react native framework.  
  
KNOWN ERRORS:  
1. Has to use 50 songs rather than whole list of playlist songs due to request limit
2. Must let it load fully before selecting mood
3. Errors appearing after selecting mood (could possibly be due to developer mode)
