# Moody Web Application

OVERVIEW:
The moody web application uses Spotify data to collect your favourite songs on Spotify and sort and display them based on the current mood youâ€™re in.  

DESCRIPTION:  
Developed using the react native framework, the moody application uses spotify API to access users playlist data. This playlist data is then sorted using audio data, such as song valence, energy and danceability.  

KNOWN ERRORS:  
    1. Can only use 50 random songs from users playlist data due to API request contraints  
    2. Must let it load fully before selecting mood  
    3. Errors appearing after selecting mood (could possibly be due to developer mode)
